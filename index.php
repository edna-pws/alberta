                  Brown Bagging for Calgary’s Kids (BB4CK) is a local not-for-profit organization that works towards ensuring 
    there are no hungry kids in Calgary’s schools. BB4CK strives towards this goal each day by providing healthy lunches directly to children and by empowering the communities around them to create lasting social change.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Through the help of our 6 staff and 1500 annual volunteers BB4CK are currently providing lunches to 2000 
    children each day! Due to generous discounts from many local vendors the cost of a lunch for a child is 
    only $1.00. This absolutely means that this is a problem we can solve. Every child in Calgary should be able 
    to access the healthy food they need to be as successful as possible.
